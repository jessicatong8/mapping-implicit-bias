            <p> Implicit bias is an unconscious mental association between a certain quality and social category, such as race.
                Mapped across a population, average implicit racial bias is a reflection of systemic racism. </p>

        <p> Implicit racial bias is measured by the Race Implicit Association Test (IAT). 
            Individually, higher implicit bias scores indicate a stronger association between white and good compared to black and good. 
            Averaged across populations, higher scores reflect greater systemic racism. 
        </p>

        <h2 id = "about"> What is Implicit Bias? </h2>

        <p>
            Implicit bias refers to automatic mental associations that can shape our perceptions and decisions without our conscious awareness. 
            Implicit biases are learned through our experiences with inequalities and stereotypes in our environments.
        </p>

        <h2> How is Implicit Bias Measured? </h2>

        <p>
            The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is the best known and most widely used tool for measuring implicit bias. 
            This visualization uses Race IAT data from  over 4 million particpiants. 
            The Race IAT measures the strength of associations between race (White, Black) and evaluations (good, bad), and higher scores indicate a stronger association between white and good compared to black and good. 
            You can take the test yourself <a href = https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html>here</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Implicit Bias as a Reflection of Systemic Racism</h2>

        <p>
            Implicit bias is measured on the individual level and is often treated in research as an individual attitude.
             But, a person's implicit bias is not strongly associated with their behavior, nor is it stable over time. 
        </p>

        <p>
            However, implicit bias becomes a stable, predictive measure when averaged across populations.
            Regions in the U.S. with higher levels of implicit race bias also have greater racial disparities in police shootings. 
            County-level implicit bias is associated with health disparities, and state-level implicit bias is associated with the frequency of internet searches for racial slurs. 
            Implicit biases are shaped by experiences with inequalities and stereotypes in the environment, and places with greater systemic inequalities increase the accessibility of stereotypes that form implicit biases. 
            Average implicit bias in a given location is a predictor of discrimination in that environment, and can be considered a cognitive reflection of systemic racism. 
        </p>

        <h2>Why does Mapping Implicit Bias Matter?</h2>

        <p>
            Mapping aggregated implicit bias scores visualizes systemic racism, driving impactful, actionable questions:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> What are the root causes of implicit biases? What historical, political, and cultural contexts make an environment more biased?</li>
            <li> What features of our environments make stereotypes more accessible?</li>
            <li> How can our spaces, communities, and institutions be designed to reduce implicit biases? </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Aggregate implicit bias changes at the rate the social environment changes. 
            Metros where diversity increased the most over time had reductions in implicit bias. 
            Anti-gay bias declined quickly states that legalized same-sex marriage, and anti-fat bias increased in weeks following fat-shaming events in mass media.             
        </p>

        <p>
            Visualizing implicit bias empowers policymakers and community members with the insights into how our laws, institutions, and norms can change to reduce the structural inequalities in our environments.
