            <p> Implicit bias is an unconscious mental association between a certain quality and social category, such as race.
                Mapped across a population, average implicit racial bias is a reflection of systemic racism. </p>

        <p> Implicit racial bias is measured by the Race Implicit Association Test (IAT). 
            Individually, higher implicit bias scores indicate a stronger association between white and good compared to black and good. 
            Averaged across populations, higher scores reflect greater systemic racism.

        <h2 id = "about"> What is Implicit Bias? </h2>

        <p>
            Implicit bias refers to automatic mental associations that can shape our perceptions and decisions without our conscious awareness. 
            Implicit biases are learned through our experiences with inequalities and stereotypes in our environments.
        </p>

        <h2> How is Implicit Bias Measured? </h2>

        <p>
            The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is the best known and most widely used tool for measuring implicit bias. 
            Data for this visualization is derived from the Race IAT, where over x number of pariticipants have completed the task of quickly categorizing white and black faces as well as positive and negative words. 
            Since categorizing easier when concepts are closely related, response times are a measure of the strength of associations between concepts. 
            Higher Race IAT scores indicate a stronger association between white and good compared to black and good. 
            You can take the test yourself through the <a href = https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html>Project Implicit research website</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Implicit Bias as a Reflection of Systemic Racism</h2>

        <p>
            Implicit bias is measured on the individual level and is often treated in research as an individual attitude.
             But, a person's implicit bias is not strongly associated with their behavior, nor is it stable over time. 
        </p>

        <p>
            However, implicit bias becomes a stable, predictive measure when averaged across populations.
            Regions in the U.S. with higher levels of implicit race bias also have greater racial disparities in police shootings. 
            County-level implicit bias is associated with health disparities, and state-level implicit bias is associated with the frequency of internet searches for racial slurs. 
            Implicit biases are shaped by experiences with inequalities and stereotypes in the environment, and places with greater systemic inequalities increase the accessibility of stereotypes that form implicit biases. 
            Average implicit bias in a given location is a predictor of discrimination in that environment, and can be considered a cognitive reflection of systemic racism. 
        </p>

        <h2>Why does Mapping Implicit Bias Matter?</h2>

        <p>
            Mapping aggregated implicit bias scores visualizes systemic racism, driving impactful, actionable questions:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> What are the root causes of implicit biases? What historical, political, and cultural contexts make an environment more biased?</li>
            <li> What features of our environments make stereotypes more accessible?</li>
            <li> How can our spaces, communities, and institutions be designed to reduce implicit biases? </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Quantifying and visualizing implicit bias empowers policymakers and community members with data-driven psychological insights into the structural inequalities in our environments.
